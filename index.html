        <h2>About Kyle</h2>
            <p>
                After graduating HighSchool, I joined the Military, which has led to a very rewarding career as a Signaleer.
                After 12 years and multiple deployments, I am ready to move on to the next chapter in my life, Software Engineering!
            </p>
            <p>
                My love for technology started at a young age building computer systems with my Father. I have always has a desire to learn
                more about computers and how they work. My first encounter with software was my interest in reverse-engineering game files
                with my friends. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When I am not coding or learning how to improve my coding skills, You will find me out on the boat, tracking down the biggest
                fish I can find, or up in my tree stand during hunting season. I am also always rennovating my house.
